While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggests he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver, a charming American scholar working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.",

Frustrated and nearing the end of his research grant, Simon has yet to find evidence of the existence of the elusive Yeti and prove his hypothesis that the Yeti is the missing link in human evolution. Given a three-month reprieve by his wealthy yet suspicious investor, Simon reluctantly accepts Nelly's help as they set out on a mission through the Himalayas in search of the Yeti.

With Tensing, their young Sherpa guide, and Jasmin, a chatty myna bird, by their side, what could possibly go wrong?",

Kathy Burke brings together a talented comedic cast including the Olivier Award winning actress Samantha Spiro as Mrs Erlynne, Kevin Bishop as Lord Darlington, and guest starring Jennifer Saunders as the Duchess of Berwick, marking her return to the West End stage for the first time in over twenty years. This is the second play from the Oscar Wilde Season, a year-long celebration of the brilliant Victorian playwright being staged by Classic Spring, a new theatre company led by Dominic Dromgoole, former Artistic Director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe.\n\nThe day of Lady Windermere\u2019s birthday party, and all is perfectly in order. Until her friend Lord Darlington plants a seed of suspicion. Is her husband having an affair? And will the other woman really attend the party? First performed in 1892, Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan explores the ambiguity of upper class morality and the fragile position of women in society in the late Victorian era in one of Wilde\u2019s most popular and witty plays.",
